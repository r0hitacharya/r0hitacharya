Philosophy:
With a decade-plus of experience in a diverse array of data roles across three different domains, I have strived to develop a T-shaped personality that enables me to think laterally and tackle complex problems. My vision is to help organizations transcend the barriers to AI adoption and unlock its full potential in the digital age.

As a member of NTT's Sales Intelligence Operations team, my primary focus is on developing a comprehensive AI strategy that sets a clear direction for establishing a vision for the AI Center of Excellence (COE)

At NTT's Global Client Success, I leverage data-driven insights to proactively match dedicated managers with clients, identifying mutually beneficial relationships through data science techniques. Our program leverages automated success plays, powered by data-driven triggers, to optimize client relationships and revenue growth.

My journey with Zalora has been in evolving analytics from the ground up by implementing self-service analytics platform by managing internal, external and team dependent stakeholders. developing data infrastructure whenever needed and enabling key decision makers in the company by providing them with cutting-edge analytic insights.

My tenure at Marina Bay Sands, a premier and iconic destination in Singapore, was dedicated to leveraging analytics to enhance gaming experiences. I focused on data-driven personalization initiatives for Paiza (VIP) clientele, orchestrating financial planning for baccarat and blackjack tournaments, and optimizing table revenue metrics and player retention. These experiences provided me unique insights into the gaming industry and the importance of delivering exceptional customer experiences.

My experience collaborating with European and Southeast Asian teams at Zalora, engaging high-net-worth Asian clients at Marina Bay Sands, and addressing diverse industry use cases in a global role at NTT has solidified my pursuit of a T-shaped skill set

My global perspective has been meticulously cultivated through annual explorations of the world's diverse cultures, with a personal goal to visit at least two new countries each year.

I am eager to connect with professionals over engaging conversations - from serene park stroll, derivative trading, artisanal coffee, or during a spirited game of badminton or soccer. Let's discuss data and explore vegan breakfast spots.

Paper Title: A Knowledge Based Approach for Recognizing Textual Entailment for Natural Language Inference using Data Mining
Abstract: The paper proposes a knowledge-based approach to recognizing textual entailment (RTE), a crucial task in natural language understanding. Traditional methods like bag-of-words and formal logic have shown limitations in RTE. To address this, the authors integrate lexical resources like WordNet, VerbNet, and ConceptNet into a rich knowledge base to provide semantic and structural information about English words. This knowledge base is then used to mine large amounts of text, which is appropriately classified. An inference system utilizes the mined data to determine the entailment relationship between text pairs.
The proposed approach is implemented in a movie search engine where RTE is applied to movie summaries or plots to improve movie classification and search accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate encouraging outcomes, including reduced search time and increased accuracy. This work represents the first application of RTE to information search in the form of a movie search engine.

Few important quotes I believe in:
1.You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you're finished, you'll know absolutely nothing, So let's look at the bird and see what it's doing — that's what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. - Feynman
